<a class=flex-item href=https://tane.dev/tags/exploits>Exploits</a>
<a class=flex-item href=https://tane.dev/tags/security>Security</a></div></div><div class=post-content><p>Last week, after a call with the engineers on my team I wanted to send a message to two of the engineers at the same time - little did I know I&rsquo;d find what I believe to be a nasty privacy exploit in <a href=https://slack.com target=_blank>Slack</a>
- one that made me ask &ldquo;Why is this <em>even</em> a feature?&rdquo;</p><p>Like any good responsible software engineer, instead of taking to social media or forums to post about the exploit - I opted to report it to <a href=https://hackerone.com target=_blank>HackerOne</a>
- where Slack accepts reports of potential security exploits. After giving a detailed list of instructions on how to achive it (Report #2171907).</p><p>Shortly after (within 40 minutes) I recieved a reply which slightly dumbfounded me - the full reply is below, but began &ldquo;We have reviewed your submission, and while this behavior is not perfectly ideal, it is intended.&rdquo;</p><p>After asking some people in the Infosec community what is the right next step, I was advised that I&rsquo;m within my rights to inform about this, mostly to give fair warning to Slack users that this exploit exists.</p><h2 id=unforeseen-consequences>Unforeseen Consequences</h2><p>So what was this exploit I found - in some way it&rsquo;s so deliciously simple, that I had to double check it actually happened. I found it by using Slack &ldquo;as intended&rdquo; - but the result was not what was expected, with an unclear UI about the consequences - and I believe for most users who may experience it, would not realise what has happened. Certainly in the moment it could cause real harm to users, under certain circumstances.</p><p>The list of actions is as follows:</p><ol><li>Click on a user in Direct Messages</li><li>Click on the user name at the top where the chevron is located</li><li>Click "Add people to this coversation" (up to 9 people)</li><li>Add one or more users to the conversation</li></ol><p>You will now receive a popup with several options - in this case, because I couldn&rsquo;t find the original DM with the pair of engineers in the UI it seemed like the option &ldquo;Include conversation history?&rdquo; seemed sensible.</p><p><em>In hindsight, it does have a message at the top of the screen - but in the moment as many know, these messages when not labeled as warnings can be missed or ignored by users -</em> <strong>or any bad actor with access to the appropriate Slack account</strong></p><p>So now a private DM conversation, going all the way back to the beginning of this history has now been shared with all the people added to it, attachments and all.</p><p><strong>The person in the DM thread received no consent to allow this action.</strong></p><p>But what now makes it worse is that this whole DM is now a thread, and a thread can be turned into a private channel.</p><p>Once turned into a private channel, the original person in the DM can be removed from the entire room - no longer having access to any of the messages. Also as a channel a much larger number of people (like a whole organisation) can be added to it.</p><h2 id=ok-what-now>OK, what now?</h2><p>So the functionality is working as intended.</p><p>But what if I&rsquo;m a disgruntled employee who has some DMs with a board member who was sharing internal confidential information? Or a bully who happens to find an unlocked computer of a fellow employee they know is in a secret relationship? Or a hacker who has managed to get into a key account of a Slack that hasn&rsquo;t enabled 2FA, or via a magic link in their email account because of a weak password?</p><p><a href=https://slack.com/intl/en-au/blog/news/slack-security-update target=_blank>Its not like unauthorised access to systems is not a thing</a>
&mldr;</p><h2 id=slacks-reply-and-caveats>Slack&rsquo;s reply and caveats</h2><p>To be fair to Slack, I will include the response below where they include their reasons why this is &ldquo;as intended&rdquo;.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you the reader to decide if it&rsquo;s enough of a mitigation, or if many companies would even have the processes to begin to deal with this an an immediate threat - I can guess many companies using it don&rsquo;t even have a dedicated CSO, team managing slack - and likely use default settings.</p><blockquote><p>Thank you for your report.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We have reviewed your submission, and while this behavior is not perfectly ideal, it is intended. In this “attack”, a user must have the permission to create private Channels, and this can be restricted by Owners/Admins.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In addition, the DM messages are not truly deleted when performing this behavior. An Admin/Owner with the necessary permissions to manage private Channels can always access the content within private Channels if necessary.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For these reasons, we are relatively satisfied with our security at this time, and we will be closing this report as Informative. Regardless, we appreciate your efforts here, and hope you continue to submit to our program.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Thanks, and good luck with your future bug hunting.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class=post><div class=post-heading><h1><a href=https://tane.dev/2023/04/i-think-i-found-a-privacy-exploit-in-chatgpt/>I Think I Found a Privacy Exploit in ChatGPT</a></h1><div class=meta><i class="far fa-calendar-edit" title="The date when this post was originally published" aria-label="The date when this post was originally published"></i><span>&nbsp;Published: Apr 14, 2023</span>

<code>Initially, I thought these might be hallucinations, but now I suspect they could also include other users' responses from the API</code></p><p>Last month, OpenAI unveiled their advanced large language model, <a href=https://openai.com/product/gpt-4 target=_blank>ChatGPT-4</a>
, attracting attention from developers, enterprises, media, and <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/31/italy-privacy-watchdog-bans-chatgpt-over-data-breach-concerns target=_blank>governments</a>
alike.</p><p>Before receiving my GPT-4 invite, I experimented with <a href=ttps://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp>alpaca.cpp</a>
, designed to run models on CPU&rsquo;s with limited memory constraints. I began by developing a simple web interface using NodeJS and sockets for parsing the command line. Once I started working with the GPT-4 API, I quickly realized that with the right prompts, it could be a powerful tool. It has already helped me rewrite complex code into simpler methods and reduce complexity by moving code to functions:</p><div style=text-align:center><img src=https://tane.dev/images/chatgpt-code-improvement.png width=60% height=60% alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT suggesting a code improvement for creating tables by proposing a cell creation method"></div><p>However, I noticed something peculiar — due to a bug in my code, I was sending empty prompts to the ChatGPT endpoint, but I still received seemingly random responses ranging from standard AI model introductions to information about people, places, and concepts. Inspired by the coinciding <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922 target=_blank>#StochasticParrotsDay</a>
online conference, I transformed this into a <a href=https://mastodon.social/@StochasticEntropy target=_blank>Mastodon Bot</a>
(now moved to <a href=https://botsin.space/@StochasticEntropy target=_blank>botsin.space</a>
).</p><p>After running the bot for a month, I concluded that a significant portion of the responses without prompts <strong>might be responses for other users</strong>, potentially due to a bug that sends unintended responses when given an unsanitized empty prompt.</p><p>These could be stochastic hallucinations, random training data pulled out by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29 target=_blank>Entropy</a>
, or a mix of all three possibilities.</p><p>If this is the case, then ChatGPT would not be much better than a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain target=_blank>Markov Chain</a>
, and the entire large language model/AI market has been playing us for fools.</p><p><em>However if I am correct</em> then the current OpenAI APIs could be made to potentially leak private or sensitive data, by simply not sanatising their inputs&mldr;</p><p>The bot will continue to run until at least the end of this month, and all the content will be archive at <a href=https://stochasticparrot.lol target=_blank>stochasticparrot.lol</a>

it was first closed it as <code>Not Applicable</code> with a response about the model, I re-itterated it was about the API.

In the end I opted to use <a href=https://github.com/tanepiper/Stochastic-Parrot/actions target=_blank>GitHub Actions</a>
with scheduled tasks to create it - this allowed me to set up a script that ran hourly - calling the ChatGPT API with an empty
prompt, and turning it into a toot. I also found that passing only a space character to the Dall-E API also produced images.</p><p>With both scripts, after getting a response from OpenAI, I use it to generate one or more toots - depending on the length as a set of replies, with the images
first download them and then upload them as attachments first.</p><p>Some of the more recent toots are below - ones with a parrot emjoi (🦜) are created without a prompt, while if a prompt is used I add a speech bubble (💬)
to indicate</p><div class=toots></div><p>Once I had this up and running, I then created a small <a href=https://astro.build target=_blank>AstroJS</a>
<a href=https://stochasticparrot.lol/ target=_blank>website</a>
that outputs each entry as a posting.</p><h3 id=making-polly-speak>Making Polly Speak</h3><p>Up to this point, I had just been working with text and images - but I had recently seen <a href=http://elevenlabs.io/ target=_blank>ElevenLabs</a>
in some tech news, and that they had a text-to-speech API. After some initial issues (which used up all of the free credit) - I eventually set up another action that took the OpenAI response, and passed it to the ElevenLabs API - this then provided a MP3 stream of the speech, saved locally and again upload to Mastodon and attach to a toot.</p><div class=toots></div><p>I also decided to try see if I could get it to generate some polls. With some <a href=https://github.com/tanepiper/Stochastic-Parrot/blob/main/packages/stochastic-parrot/src/poll.mjs#L34 target=_blank>gentle prompting</a>
I was able to get it to generate JSON output which could be used in polls. Sadly, most of the time it seems to repeat the same questions over and over with just slightly different wording, occasionally coming up with something original</p><div class=toots></div><p>I even went as far as trying to generate video content - not through Stable Diffusion, but by generating text themes to use with the <a href=https://creatomate.com/ target=_blank>Createomate</a>
API - allowing me to generate social media &ldquo;fact&rdquo; videos. Unfortunatly this was a bit buggy, and due to the way Mastodon works can time out quite a bit.</p><div class=toots><article class="toot h-entry"><section class=toot-header><div class=inner><div rel=author class="h-card p-author toot-avatar"><img class=u-photo width=50 src=https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/110/040/867/511/382/207/original/5f9b9ea5a76bd34d.png>

to handle form validation and submission - it uses the validation properties of HTML5 forms directly, meaning you can
create progressive, accessible forms first.</p><p>The library is for use with the <a href=https://svelte.dev/docs#use_action target=_blank>use directive</a>
and can be bound to any element, not
just <code>&lt;form></code> ones and the library automatically handles subscription and unsubscription to any form element with
a <code>name</code> attribute.</p><p>Here is the example from the demo:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-html data-lang=html><span style=display:flex><span>

displaying errors and error states are via the <code>validity</code> object and the <code>touched</code> object allows us to only apply it
when the form element is first focused on.</p><p>The release is considered an <code>alpha</code> version - the API may change and there are still tests and documentation to right -
but you can try it our right now in your own project with <code>npm install svelte-formula</code> - any bugs, issues or suggestions

HTML <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog target=_blank>dialog</a>
tag is and each time I&rsquo;m reminded me of
an <a href=https://tinynodes.medium.com/dark-patterns-with-the-html-5-2-dialog-tag-and-chrome-for-fun-and-profit-249ce092d200 target=_blank>old Medium post</a>
I made a few years ago about its use.</p><p>The <strong>good</strong> news is in 2021 it&rsquo;s much harder to use it to crash a user&rsquo;s browser - in
Firefox <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=840640" target=_blank>dialog.showModal is behind a flag</a>
so it has to be
specifically enabled by users. In all browsers <strong>preferred</strong> way to use this tag in 2021 is to use the <code>open</code> attribute
which is a much more sensible way of using the tag. However, it
is <a href=https://stackblitz.com/edit/dialog-dark-patterns-property target=_blank>still possible</a>
to do some things mentioned below
and <a href=https://tane.dev/images/firefox-dialog-performance.png>kill browser performance</a>
(and it&rsquo;s still possible to steal focus in
Chrome).</p><p>I thought it would be a good opportunity to revisit it as I feel it still has issues that makes it a <em>potentially</em>
dangerous tag to use on the web <em>without thinking about the implementation</em>. One thing that blogpost (and me pointing it
out) does is bring out people to say it&rsquo;s nothing to do with the platform&mldr;</p><p><img src=https://tane.dev/images/do-shit-with-browsers.png alt="So you discovered you can do shit in the browser an mess with the user"><br><img src=https://tane.dev/images/haters-gonna-hate.png alt="Except that nothing of this is related to the dialog tag, nor is the fact that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;built-in&rdquo;. If the argument is &ldquo;the built-in dialog should be restricted so that people can&rsquo;t abuse it&rdquo;, all you&rsquo;re doing is making sure abusers use a div (or different elem) as dialog instead."></p><p>Certainly, some people didn&rsquo;t agree - and it would be a valid suggestions to say this is achievable in other ways.
However, several years later I still stand by my original points:</p><ul><li>By
default, <a href=https://stackblitz.com/edit/dialog-dark-patterns-with-div target=_blank>library modals do not completely steal the users mouse focus</a>
even when in a loop of generating modals you can click elsewhere on the page (although of course they always can be
made to!)</li><li>It&rsquo;s still very easy to <a href=https://tane.dev/images/firefox-dialog-performance.png>kill browser performance</a>
very easily, very quickly
because there is no limit to the number of dialogs that can be created</li><li>The <code>&lt;dialog></code> tag is built into the platform, so there&rsquo;s no way to stop its use by blocking any offending library
code - bad actors have all the tools to do this available in the DOM with a single HTML file.</li><li>A single API is also a single attack surface - any script injection attacks don&rsquo;t have to worry about library-specific
implementations - they can
<strong>always</strong> rely on <code>document.getElementsByTagName('dialog')</code> to access <code>&lt;dialog></code> elements on the page.</li></ul><p>Over the last few years, users have also been taught bad habits to click any popup in operating systems, or in the
browser through the use of Cookie popups, newsletter popups and other generally badly implemented ideas.</p><h2 id=revisiting-the-hacks>Revisiting The Hacks</h2><p>Now on StackBlitz, I&rsquo;m using the <a href=https://stackblitz.com/edit/dialog-dark-patterns target=_blank>same demo as before</a>
with some
updates. The example does the following:</p><ul><li>Adds a listener over the close button which, when the user hovers over it disables the button and moves the modal.</li><li>Adds a second close button that when pressed closes the modal but also triggers an undesirable path (such as
installing malware because we have
a <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted target=_blank>trusted user-triggered Event</a>
that allows Web
APIs)</li><li>2 Buttons that send you into a loop of death in infinitely creating modals that can&rsquo;t be escaped, and always steals
focus.</li><li>Hijacking the users keyboard, so users cannot use <code>Esc</code>, not can they <code>Tab</code> away from the dialog or use <code>Space</code> to
click any buttons.</li></ul><h2 id=overriding-the-dom-for-fun>Overriding the DOM for fun</h2><p>One issue is that you pretty much have full control over the DOM of the dialog. This is good in many ways, but with
great power&mldr;</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-js data-lang=js><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>function</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>createModal</span>() {

<code>alert</code> - allowing the user to set <code>Don't show popus anymore for this website</code> when it&rsquo;s abused by developers.</p></blockquote><h2 id=component-solution>Component Solution</h2><p>One way around this in your own code is to use the <code>&lt;dialog></code> tag only within your own components - I’ve
created <a href=https://stackblitz.com/edit/dialog-dark-patterns-shadowroot target=_blank>another example with a web component</a>
that embeds
the dialog in to a <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot target=_blank>ShadowRoot</a>
and provides the global a
state, so you cannot open more than one at a time and third-party scripts cannot access the internal <code>&lt;dialog></code>.</p><p>Hopefully you enjoy the demo and this post. I&rsquo;m not against the use of dialogs themselves - but I think providing some
way to limit the number of modals that can be shown, and limit what can and cannot be changed within it would provide a
deeper layer of secure use across the web platform.</p></div></div><div class=post><div class=post-heading><h1><a href=https://tane.dev/2021/02/webserial.app-browser-to-usb-serial-communication-with-svelte/>WebSerial.app - Browser to USB Serial Communication With Svelte</a></h1><div class=meta><i class="far fa-calendar-edit" title="The date when this post was originally published" aria-label="The date when this post was originally published"></i><span>&nbsp;Published: Feb 5, 2021</span>
